    "# Gray-Scott Model of a Reaction-Diffusion System\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gray-Scott model is a reaction-diffusion system. Reaction-Diffusion systens describe systems where substances diffuse and react with each other. The Gray-Scott model specifically describes a chemical reaction between two substances, often referred to as U and V where both substances diffuse over time.\n",
    "During the reaction `U` is used up and `V` is produced. \n",
    "The system is desscribed by follwing parameters:\n",
    "`F` and `K` are feed and kill rates, respectively. `F` controls the rate at which substance `U` is added to the system, while `K` controls the rate at which substance `V` is removed.\n",
    "Furthermore there are diffusion rates `Du` and `Dv` for substances `U` and `V`, respectively. These rates determine how quickly each substance spreads out over the spatial domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gray-Scott Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gray-Scott model is governed by the following partial differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```∂U/∂t = Du * ∇²U - U * V² + F * (1 - U)```\n",
    "\n",
    "```∂V/∂t = Dv * ∇²V + U * V² - (F + K) * V```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `∂U/∂t` and `∂V/∂t` are the time derivatives of concentrations `U` and `V`.\n",
    "- `∇²U` and `∇²V` are the Laplacians of `U` and `V`, representing diffusion.\n",
    "- `U * V²` represents the reaction term where `U` is consumed to produce `V`.\n",
    "- `F * (1 - U)` represents the feed term for `U`.\n",
    "- `(F + K) * V` represents the removal term for `V`.    \n",
